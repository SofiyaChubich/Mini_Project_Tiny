# Mini_Project_Tiny - Sofiya Chubich
Main Idea? text RPG mainly based on the DnD mechanics.
What does it mean? The player starts off by getting a randomized class (Barbarian, rogue or bard) -> A start event boots up with the first boss, the player is going to have several choices on how to deal with it ->  if the player survives, he advances onto his next “adventure”, aka 3 randomized events, which could contain mini bosses, loot and other quirky stuff -> after 3 events the player moves on to the middle point of the quest boss fight -> 3 more randomized events -> final boss fight!
Why am I doing this? Games are fun and DnD is awesome.
What are some specific game mechanics? The player will “roll the dice” (random number between 1 and 20), and the roll will be added to the player’s stats which will determine their fail or success. There will be healing potion (the amount of health healed will depend on the dice rolls), weapon and armor upgrades. Players will also have special skills dependent on their background.
UI? Pop up window with text on it. If you want to make a choice type in its number.
Background? The stats of the character will depend on their background, as well as their starting weapons and armor. Their special skills will also be dependent on the background.
